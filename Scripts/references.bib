   abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that are able to regulate the expression of targeted mRNAs. Thousands of miRNAs have been identified; however, only a few of them have been functionally annotated. Microarray-based expression analysis represents a cost-effective way to identify candidate miRNAs that correlate with specific biological pathways, and to detect disease-associated molecular signatures. Generally, microarray-based miRNA data analysis contains four major steps: (1) quality control and normalization, (2) differential expression analysis, (3) target gene prediction, and (4) functional annotation. For each step, a large couple of software tools or packages have been developed. In this chapter, we present a standard analysis pipeline for miRNA microarray data, assembled by packages mainly developed with R and hosted in Bioconductor project.},

   abstract = {Recent studies have established that mutations or deletions in microRNA (miRNA) processing enzymes resulting in a global decrease of miRNA expression are frequent across cancers and can be associated with a poorer prognosis. While very popular in miRNA profiling studies, it remains unclear whether miRNA microarrays are suited or not to accurately detecting global miRNA decreases seen in cancers. In this work, we analyzed the miRNA profiles of samples with global miRNA decreases using Affymetrix miRNA microarrays following the inducible genetic deletion of Dicer1. Surprisingly, up to a third of deregulated miRNAs identified upon Dicer1 depletion were found to be up-regulated following standard robust multichip average (RMA) background correction and quantile normalization, indicative of normalization bias. Our comparisons of five preprocess steps performed at the probe level demonstrated that the use of cyclic loess relying on non-miRNA small RNAs present on the Affymetrix platform significantly improved specificity and sensitivity of detection of decreased miRNAs. These findings were validated in samples from patients with prostate cancer, where conjugation of robust normal-exponential background correction with cyclic loess normalization and array weights correctly identified the greatest number of decreased miRNAs, and the lowest amount of false-positive up-regulated miRNAs. These findings highlight the importance of miRNA microarray normalization for the detection of miRNAs that are truly differentially expressed and suggest that the use of cyclic loess based on non-miRNA small RNAs can help to improve the sensitivity and specificity of miRNA profiling in cancer samples with global miRNA decrease.},

@article{Wang2013,
   abstract = {Microarray is a high throughput discovery tool that has been broadly used for genomic research. Probe-target hybridization is the central concept of this technology to determine the relative abundance of nucleic acid sequences through fluorescence-based detection. In microarray experiments, variations of expression measurements can be attributed to many different sources that influence the stability and reproducibility of microarray platforms. Normalization is an essential step to reduce non-biological errors and to convert raw image data from multiple arrays (channels) to quality data for further analysis. In general, for the traditional microarray analysis, most established normalization methods are based on two assumptions: (1) the total number of target genes is large enough (>10,000); and (2) the expression level of the majority of genes is kept constant. However, microRNA (miRNA) arrays are usually spotted in low density, due to the fact that the total number of miRNAs is less than 2,000 and the majority of miRNAs are weakly or not expressed. As a result, normalization methods based on the above two assumptions are not applicable to miRNA profiling studies. In this review, we discuss a few representative microarray platforms on the market for miRNA profiling and compare the traditional methods with a few novel strategies specific for miRNA microarrays.},
